During a certain point in time I was very bored, and a friend of mine requested some assistance with an issue he was facing.

He was running a business, with the main support being handled through discord. He wanted to get a clear view on how much work each of his employees were doing, so that they could be compensated for their time fairly. Due to me being interested in undertaking a new project, I offered to assist him with this, as a result, Monitor was born.

Monitor was quite simple in function, it would read all messages posted, see if the userID of the person that wrote the message matches someone that's registered as an employee, if so, it gets logged. The way it's handled means that only x messages over a certain duration matter, if someone were to spam, it wouldn't count it any different. 

The final result would then be output into an excel sheet for easy viewing. Logs were done every hour, and through some simple excel formatting, it was plain to see who was doing a lot and who was doing very little work. It also clearly showed where downtime was of having no employees available.

It ended up not being entirely finished, due to me getting busy with my actual job, but it did see a lot of use despite being in this 'alpha' state.
